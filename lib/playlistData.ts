When she was just a girl
She expected the world
But it flew away from her reach
So she ran away in her sleep

And dreamed of para-, para-, paradise
Para-, para-, paradise
Para-, para-, paradise
Every time she closed her eyes

Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh

She expected the world
But it flew away from her reach
And the bullets catch in her teeth

The wheel breaks the butterfly
Every tear, a waterfall
In the night, the stormy night, she'd close her eyes
In the night, the stormy night, away she'd fly

And dream of para-, para-, paradise

You don't know how lovely you are

I had to find you
Tell you I need you
Tell you I set you apart

Tell me your secrets
And ask me your questions
Oh, let's go back to the start

Running in circles
Coming up tails
Heads on a science apart

Nobody said it was easy
It's such a shame for us to part
Nobody said it was easy
No one ever said it would be this hard

Oh, take me back to the start

I was just guessing
At numbers and figures
Pulling the puzzles apart

Questions of science
Science and progress
Do not speak as loud as my heart

Tell me you love me
Come back and haunt me
Oh, and I rush to the start

Running in circles
Chasing our tails
Coming back as we are

Seas would rise when I gave the word
Now in the morning I sleep alone
Sweep the streets I used to own

I used to roll the dice
Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes
Listened as the crowd would sing,
"Now the old king is dead! Long live the king!"
One minute I held the key
Next the walls were closed on me
And I discovered that my castles stand
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand

I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing
Roman cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
Once you'd gone there was never
Never an honest word
And that was when I ruled the world

It was a wicked and wild wind
Blew down the doors to let me in
Shattered windows and the sound of drums
People couldn't believe what I'd become
Revolutionaries wait
For my head on a silver plate
Just a puppet on a lonely string
Oh who would ever want to be king?

I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing
Roman cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
I know St. Peter won't call my name
Never an honest word
But that was when I ruled the world

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

This particular diamond was extra special
And though you might be gone
And the world may not know
Still I see you celestial

Like a lion you ran
A goddess you rolled
Like an eagle you circled
In perfect purple
So how come things move on
How come cars don't slow
When it feels like the end of my world?
When I should but I can't let you go?

But when I'm cold, cold
When I'm cold, cold
There's a light that you give me
When I'm in shadow
There's a feeling you give me, an everglow

Like brothers in blood
Sisters who ride
And we swore on that night
We'd be friends 'til we die
But the changing of winds
And the way waters flow
Life as short as the falling of snow
And now I'm gonna miss you, I know

But when I'm cold, cold
In water rolled, salt
And I know that you're with me
And the way you will show
And you're with me wherever I go
'Cause you give me this feeling, this everglow

What I wouldn't give for just a moment to hold
Yeah, I live for this feeling, this everglow

So if you love someone, you should let them know

Saw the lights go down and standing in front of me

Wooh, ooh ooh ooh

In my scarecrow dreams
When they smash my heart into smithereens
Be a bright red rose come bursting the concrete
Be a cartoon heart
Light a fire, a fire, a spark
Light a fire, a flame in my heart

We'll be glowing in the dark

Wooh, ooh ooh ooh

All the boys, all the girls
All that matters in the world
All the boys, all the girls
All the madness that occurs
All the highs, all the lows

And I know I was wrong
But I won't let you down
(Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, I will, yes I will)

I say oh
I cry oh

Yeah I saw sparks
Yeah I saw sparks
And I saw sparks
Yeah I saw sparks

Sing it out

  { id: 22, title: "Fix You", lyrics: `When you try your best, but you don't succeed
When you get what you want, but not what you need
When you feel so tired, but you can't sleep
Stuck in reverse
And the tears come streaming down your face
When you lose something you can't replace
When you love someone, but it goes to waste
Could it be worse?

Lights will guide you home
And ignite your bones
And I will try to fix you

And high up above or down below
When you're too in love to let it go
But if you never try you'll never know
Just what you're worth

Lights will guide you home
And ignite your bones
And I will try to fix you

Tears stream down your face
When you lose something you cannot replace
Tears stream down your face and I
Tears stream down your face
I promise you I will learn from my mistakes
Tears stream down your face and I

Lights will guide you home
And ignite your bones
And I will try to fix you`, youtubeId: "bzRMneypG04" },

Oh oh
All those good good
Feelings
All those good good
Oh oh
All those good good
Feelings

We fell in love in the summer
I remember, baby
We saw the sunshine too
And we were born for each other
Just remember, baby
Whatever we go through

All the good feelings
For one another
As we danced to the radio
All the good good feelings we have for each other
Don't ever ever let them go

All the good good feelings
Don't ever let, don't ever let go
Don't ever let them go
Oh
Don't ever let, don't ever let go
All those good good feelings
Don't ever let, don't ever let go
Don't ever forget those good feelings
Don't ever let them go
All those good good

We fell in love in the summer
I remember, baby
We fell under the moon
Oh
We were born for each other
I remember when I'm millions of miles from you

All the good feelings
For one another
As we danced to the radio
All the good good feelings we have for each other
Don't ever ever let them go (Don't ever ever let them go)

All the good good feelings
Don't ever let, don't ever let go
Don't ever let them go
Oh
Don't ever let, don't ever let go

I know that this could feel like that
But I just can't stop
Let my defences drop
I know that I was born to kill
Any angel on my windowsill
But it's so dark inside
I throw the windows wide

I know, la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
I know, la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
Still I don't let go
And fields of flowers grow

Oh, it feels like
I'm fallin' in love
Maybe for the first time
Baby, it's my mind you blow
It feels like
I'm fallin' in love
You're throwin' me a lifeline
This is for a lifetime, I know

I know that in this kind of scene
Of two people there's a spark between
One gets torn apart
One gets a broken heart

I know, la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
I know, la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
Still I don't let go
And fields of flowers grow

Oh, it feels like
I'm fallin' in love
Maybe for the first time
Baby, it's my mind you blow
It feels like
I'm fallin' in love
You're throwin' me a lifeline
This is for a lifetime, I know

Ooh
Ooh (Feels like)
Woah

It feels like
I'm fallin' in love
You're throwin' me a lifeline
Oh, now for the first time
I know I'm not alone

Ah-la-la, la-la, lo-lee-lo
Ah-la-la, la-la, lo-lee-lo, oh

  { id: 25, title: "Every teardrop is a waterfall", lyrics: `I turn the music up, I got my records on
I shut the world outside until the lights come on
Maybe the streets alight, maybe the trees are gone
I feel my heart start beating to my favourite song

And all the kids they dance, all the kids all night
Until Monday morning feels another life
I turn the music up
I'm on a roll this time
And heaven is in sight

I turn the music up, I got my records on
From underneath the rubble sing a rebel song
Don't want to see another generation drop
I'd rather be a comma than a full stop

Maybe I'm in the black, maybe I'm on my knees
Maybe I'm in the gap between the two trapezes
But my heart is beating and my pulses start
Cathedrals in my heart

And we saw oh this light I swear you, emerge blinking into
To tell me it's alright
As we soar walls, every siren is a symphony
And every tear's a waterfall
Is a waterfall
Oh
Is a waterfall
Oh oh oh
Is a is a waterfall
Every tear
Is a waterfall
Oh oh oh

So you can hurt, hurt me bad
But still I'll raise the flag

Oh
It was a wa wa wa wa wa-aterfall
A wa wa wa wa wa-aterfall

Every tear
Every tear
Every teardrop is a waterfall

Every tear
Every tear
Every teardrop is a waterfall

Every tear
Every tear
Every teardrop is a waterfall

Every tear
Every tear
Every teardrop is a waterfall`, youtubeId: "2k1142nRRNA" },
