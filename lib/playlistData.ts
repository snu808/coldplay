Sometimes I just can't take it
Sometimes I just can't take it and it isn't alright
I'm not gonna make it
And I think my shoe's untied (Oh oh)

I'm like a broken record
I'm like a broken record and I'm not playing right
Drocer nekorb a ekil mi
'Til you tell me on your heavenly phone

To hold tight (Hold tight)
Come on (Come on)
Come on (Come on)
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Come on (Come on)
Come on (Come on)
Yeah, don't let go
Hold tight (Hold tight)
Hold tight (Hold tight)
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
"It's alright, it's alright," you said
I got my hands up shaking just to let you know

That you've got a higher power
Got me singing every second, dancing every hour
Oh yeah, you've got a higher power
And you're really someone I wanna know (Oh oh)

This boy is electric
This boy is electric and you're sparkling light
The universe connected
And I'm buzzing night after night after night (Oh oh)

This joy is electric
This joy is electric and you're circuiting through
I'm so happy that I'm alive
Happy I'm alive at the same time as you

'Cause you've got a higher power
Got me singing every second, dancing every hour
Oh yeah, you've got a higher power
And you're really someone I wanna know
(I wanna know, oh oh)

You've got, yeah, you've got a higher
You've got, yeah, you've got a higher
You've got, yeah, you've got a higher
You've got
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
You've got, oh, you've got a higher
You've got, yeah, you've got a higher
You've got, oh, you've got a higher
Got my hands up shaking just to let you know now

You've got a higher power
You've got me singing every second, dancing any hour
Oh yeah, you've got a higher power
You're once in any lifetime
I'm going a million miles an hour

When for so long I'd been down on my knees
Then your love song saved me over and over
For so long I'd been down on my knees
Till your love song floats me on, ee-on, oh oh`, youtubeId: "1iMb9lvwI0I" },
  { id: 2, title: "Adventure of a Lifetime", lyrics: `Turn your magic on
Umi she'd say
Everything you want's a dream away
We are legends every day
That's what she told me

Turn your magic on
To me she'd say
Everything you want's a dream away
Under this pressure
Under this weight
We are diamonds

Now I feel my heart beating
I feel my heart underneath my skin
And I feel my heart beating
Oh, you make me feel
Like I'm alive again
Alive again
Oh, you make me feel
Like I'm alive again

Said I can't go on
Not in this way
I'm a dream that died by light of day
Gonna hold up half the sky and say
Only I own me

And I feel my heart beating
I feel my heart underneath my skin
Oh, I can feel my heart beating
'Cause you make me feel
Like I'm alive again
Alive again
Oh, you make me feel
Like I'm alive again

Turn your magic on
Umi she'd say
Everything you want's a dream away
Under this pressure under this weight
We are diamonds taking shape
We are diamonds taking shape

If we've only got this life
This adventure, oh, then I
And if we've only got this life
You get me through

If we've only got this life
In this adventure, oh, then I
Want to share it with you
With you
With you
Yeah I do
Woohoo
Woohoo

Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh

When she was just a girl
She expected the world
But it flew away from her reach
So she ran away in her sleep

And dreamed of para-, para-, paradise
Para-, para-, paradise
Para-, para-, paradise
Every time she closed her eyes

Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh

When she was just a girl
She expected the world
But it flew away from her reach
And the bullets catch in her teeth

Life goes on, it gets so heavy
The wheel breaks the butterfly
Every tear, a waterfall
In the night, the stormy night, she'd close her eyes
In the night, the stormy night, away she'd fly

And dream of para-, para-, paradise
Para-, para-, paradise
Para-, para-, paradise
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
She'd dream of para-, para-, paradise
Para-, para-, paradise
Para-, para-, paradise
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh

La, la-la, la-la-la
La, la-la, la-la-la
La, la-la, la-la-la, la-la
So lying underneath those stormy skies
She said, "Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, I know the sun must set to rise"

This could be para-, para-, paradise
Para-, para-, paradise
This could be para-, para-, paradise
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
This could be para-, para-paradise
Para-, para-, paradise
This could be para-, para-, paradise
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh

This could be para-, para-, paradise
This could be para-, para-, paradise
This could be para-, para-, paradise

  { id: 4, title: "The Scientist", lyrics: `Come up to meet you, tell you I'm sorry
You don't know how lovely you are

I had to find you
Tell you I need you
Tell you I set you apart

Tell me your secrets
And ask me your questions
Oh, let's go back to the start

Running in circles
Coming up tails
Heads on a science apart

Nobody said it was easy
It's such a shame for us to part
Nobody said it was easy
No one ever said it would be this hard

Oh, take me back to the start

I was just guessing
At numbers and figures
Pulling the puzzles apart

Questions of science
Science and progress
Do not speak as loud as my heart

Tell me you love me
Come back and haunt me
Oh, and I rush to the start

Running in circles
Chasing our tails
Coming back as we are

Nobody said it was easy
Oh, it's such a shame for us to part
Nobody said it was easy
No one ever said it would be so hard

I'm going back to the start

Oh
Oh

  { id: 5, title: "Viva la Vida", lyrics: `I used to rule the world
Seas would rise when I gave the word
Now in the morning I sleep alone
Sweep the streets I used to own

I used to roll the dice
Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes
Listened as the crowd would sing,
"Now the old king is dead! Long live the king!"
One minute I held the key
Next the walls were closed on me
And I discovered that my castles stand
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand

I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing
Roman cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
Once you'd gone there was never
Never an honest word
And that was when I ruled the world

It was a wicked and wild wind
Blew down the doors to let me in
Shattered windows and the sound of drums
People couldn't believe what I'd become
Revolutionaries wait
For my head on a silver plate
Just a puppet on a lonely string
Oh who would ever want to be king?

I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing
Roman cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
I know St. Peter won't call my name
Never an honest word
But that was when I ruled the world

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing
Roman cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
I know St. Peter won't call my name
Never an honest word
But that was when I ruled the world`, youtubeId: "WcOmJ74OIns" },

Drink from me, drink from me
That I shoot across the sky
Symphony
That I shoot across the sky
We're on a...
Drink from me, drink from me
That I shoot across the sky
Symphony
(So high, so high)
That I shoot across the sky

[Coldplay:]
Oh, angel sent from up above
You know you make my world light up
When I was down, when I was hurt
You came to lift me up
Life is a drink, and love's a drug
Oh, now I think I must be miles up
When I was a river, dried up
You came to rain a flood

[Coldplay & Beyoncé:]
You said drink from me, drink from me
When I was so thirsty
Poured on a symphony
Now I just can't get enough
Put your wings on me, wings on me
When I was so heavy
Poured on a symphony
When I'm low, low, low, low

[Coldplay:]
I, oh, I, oh, I
Got me feeling drunk and high
So high, so high
Oh, I, oh, I, oh, I
Now I'm feeling drunk and high
So high, so high
Woo!

[Coldplay & Beyoncé:]
Oh, angel sent from up above
I feel it coursing through my blood
Life is a drink, your love's about
To make the stars come out

Put your wings on me, wings on me
When I was so heavy
Poured on a symphony
When I'm low, low, low, low

I, oh, I, oh, I
Got me feeling drunk and high
So high, so high
Oh I, oh, I, oh, I
Now I'm feeling drunk and high
So high, so high

La la la la la la la
So high, so high

So high, so high

That I shoot across the...
That I shoot across the sky
Watch me shoot across the..

  { id: 7, title: "Everglow", lyrics: `Oh they say people come
Say people go
This particular diamond was extra special
And though you might be gone
And the world may not know
Still I see you celestial

Like a lion you ran
A goddess you rolled
Like an eagle you circled
In perfect purple
So how come things move on
How come cars don't slow
When it feels like the end of my world?
When I should but I can't let you go?

But when I'm cold, cold
When I'm cold, cold
There's a light that you give me
When I'm in shadow
There's a feeling you give me, an everglow

Like brothers in blood
Sisters who ride
And we swore on that night
We'd be friends 'til we die
But the changing of winds
And the way waters flow
Life as short as the falling of snow
And now I'm gonna miss you, I know

But when I'm cold, cold
In water rolled, salt
And I know that you're with me
And the way you will show
And you're with me wherever I go
'Cause you give me this feeling, this everglow

What I wouldn't give for just a moment to hold
Yeah, I live for this feeling, this everglow

So if you love someone, you should let them know
Oh, the light that you left me will everglow`, youtubeId: "dX9VEQsDUeY" },
  { id: 8, title: "Charlie Brown", lyrics: `Wooh, ooh ooh ooh

Stole a key
Took a car downtown where the lost boys meet
Took a car downtown and took what they offered me
To set me free
I saw the lights go down at the end of the scene
Saw the lights go down and standing in front of me

Wooh, ooh ooh ooh

In my scarecrow dreams
When they smash my heart into smithereens
Be a bright red rose come bursting the concrete
Be a cartoon heart
Light a fire, a fire, a spark
Light a fire, a flame in my heart
We'll run wild
We'll be glowing in the dark

Wooh, ooh ooh ooh

We'll be glowing in the dark

All the boys, all the girls
All that matters in the world
All the boys, all the girls
All the madness that occurs
All the highs, all the lows
As the room a-spinning goes
We'll run riot
We'll be glowing in the dark

Wooh, ooh ooh ooh

So we'll soar luminous and wired
We'll be glowing in the dark`, youtubeId: "VV2GaMLv1g4" },

Look how they shine for you
And everything you do
Yeah, they were all yellow

I came along
I wrote a song for you
And all the things you do
And it was called "Yellow"

So then I took my turn
Oh what a thing to have done
And it was all yellow

Your skin
Oh yeah your skin and bones
Turn into something beautiful
Do you know
You know I love you so
You know I love you so

I swam across
I jumped across for you
Oh what a thing to do
'Cause you were all yellow

I drew a line
I drew a line for you
Oh what a thing to do
And it was all yellow

Your skin
Oh yeah your skin and bones
Turn into something beautiful
Do you know
For you I'd bleed myself dry
For you I'd bleed myself dry

It's true
Look how they shine for you
Look how they shine for you
Look how they shine for
Look how they shine for you
Look how they shine for you
Look how they shine

Look at the stars
Look how they shine for you
